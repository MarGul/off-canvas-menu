# off-canvas-menu

By basically only attaching mobile-nav-open to the body element you will have an Off-Canvas menu.

Need to style the links a bit. This can then be combined with a regular desktop menu by hiding the mobile-navigation class and mobile-nav-header class. Either through CSS or Javascript.

Just add the class mobile-nav-open to the body element to slide out the off-canvas-menu. Remove the class to hide it again.
